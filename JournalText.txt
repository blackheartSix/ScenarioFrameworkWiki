Different every task

a. Area of interest (AI): South Everon Island and city of Saint Pierre
b. Assigned area: Central Saint Pierre
c.  Enemy Forces
Enemy forces, believed to be a mechanized infantry platoon supported by light armor (BTR-70s), have established a forward operating position in the town of Saint Pierre. They are likely reinforcing their positions with static defenses (e.g., sandbags, bunkers) and are conducting regular patrols along Route D13 and the surrounding forested terrain. Enemy activity suggests preparation for a larger offensive toward the western coast. Intelligence reports confirm the presence of a mobile HQ element operating within the town center. The enemy has limited air defense capabilities, primarily MANPADS and mounted HMGs.
d. Friendly Forces
Our unit (NATO-affiliated), Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, has secured the western approach to Saint Pierre, holding key terrain around the Bellevue Ridge area. Alpha Company is conducting a blocking operation north of the AO to prevent enemy reinforcements from entering Saint Pierre from Montignac. Charlie Company is in reserve near Le Moule Airfield, prepared to conduct rapid QRF if required.
f. Civil Considerations
Civilian presence in Saint Pierre is confirmed to be low but not eliminated. Rules of Engagement (ROE) require positive identification (PID) of enemy combatants before engagement. The local population is largely non-hostile but may be coerced by enemy forces. Avoid collateral damage where possible.
